# AI Assisted Coding Progress - SME Logistic Regression Model

## Status: ✅ Finished

### Tasks:

- [x] Context analysis and requirement clarification from `notebooks/sme_decision_tree_analysis.ipynb`. (Understanding 10/10)
- [x] Generate training script `scripts/train_sme_logistic.py`.
- [x] Implement preprocessing: One-Hot Encoding + StandardScaler.
- [x] Implement Logistic Regression with L1 (Lasso) feature selection.
- [x] Generate Markdown report `model_assets/sme_logistic_report.md`.
- [x] Save model artifacts (`.pkl`) and visualization plots (ROC, Confusion Matrix).

### Final Results:

- **Model:** `model_assets/sme_logistic_v1.pkl` (AUC: 0.8004)
- **Report:** `model_assets/sme_logistic_report.md`
- **Script:** `scripts/train_sme_logistic.py`

### Progress Log:

- [x] Confirmed target: `altaSAT` prediction.
- [x] Confirmed no class balancing.
- [x] Confirmed feature selection specific for Logistic Regression.
- [x] Script name defined: `scripts/train_sme_logistic.py`.
