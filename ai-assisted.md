# AI Assisted Coding Progress - SME Decision Tree Notebook

## Status: 🟢 Planning Phase

**Current Task:** Finalizing implementation plan with Hyperparameter Tuning.

### Progress Log:

- [x] Initial context analysis (Orange workflow image + CSV).
- [x] User requirements clarified (Target: altaSAT, Filter <>'o', Split 70/30, Top 5 Features via IG).
- [x] Hyperparameter optimization requirement added.
- [x] Environment setup with `uv`.
- [x] Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- [x] Feature Selection (Information Gain replication).
- [x] Hyperparameter Selection (GridSearch).
- [x] Notebook generation with visuals and explanations.

## Final Result:

- Notebook: `notebooks/sme_decision_tree_analysis.ipynb`
- Environment: `.venv` (created with `uv`)
- Dependencies: `requirements.txt`
