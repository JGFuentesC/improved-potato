# AI Assisted Coding Progress - Fraud Model Training

## Status: ✅ Finished

### Tasks:

- [x] Context analysis and requirement clarification. (Preprocessing 10/10)
- [x] Implement preprocessing logic (approved).
- [x] Generate training script `scripts/train_fraud_model.py`.
- [x] Setup logic for CV(5) + GridSearch + ROC/AUC Assets.

### Final Results:

- **Script:** `scripts/train_fraud_model.py`
- **Output Directory:** `model_assets/` (ROC curves and .pkl)
- **Features:** One-Hot Encoding for `d_` variables, GridSearch for optimized Decision Tree.

### Progress Log:

- [x] Input file `data/fraud_sample.csv` confirmed.
- [x] Folders `scripts/` and `model_assets/` created.
- [x] Final training script generated with ROC identification (`DecisionTree_Fraud_v1`).
